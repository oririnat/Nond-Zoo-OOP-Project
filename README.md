## ZooApp Project Description
This project is a demonstration of the skills we've learned in OOP. We are building a zoo full of animals to visit and designating types of visitors and employees that work there.  Visitors should be able to specify what membership level they possses, see a resulting fee once they visit, and be able to view the details of the animals at the zoo in a concise manner.  Employees will be able to see their job description, how much they are paid, how often they work, and the animals or exhibits they are in charge of.

## Additional Details
Noteable Project Functionalities:
 - ZooIndexController uses a callAnimalRun() function to dynamically call each Animal subclass's run(). This means we can add more animals at will to our getAnimalList() and it wont need to be updated. As long as the name in the list matches the animal's java file name we're safe
 - ZooIndexController uses formatLineBreaks() to parse through console output and give Spring neater output. Line breaks are replaced with '\<br>' and as long as the view uses 'th:utext=' instead of 'th:text' it formats
 - Added a resource handling process to the main Spring Boot Application file that allows for the user to place images withing "src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/images/" and then have the be rendered inside the view by calling "images/filename.filetype" - I'm not super sure how necessary this was but I needed to do it to get my image links to work. The file in question can be found [Here](https://github.com/Dierale/ZooGroup10/blob/main/src/main/java/edu/nwmissouri/zoo10group/ZooApp.java) and the file structure to it should be visible [Here](https://github.com/Dierale/ZooGroup10/tree/main/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/images). The function in question that generates the image link is found [here in the IndexController](https://github.com/Dierale/ZooGroup10/blob/main/src/main/java/edu/nwmissouri/zoo10group/ZooIndexController.java) named getAnimalImageLink(String id). It requires an index id to get an animal's name taken from [Animal.java](https://github.com/Dierale/ZooGroup10/blob/main/src/main/java/edu/nwmissouri/zoo10group/Animal.java)'s array.  The interaction is likely needlessly complicated, but it works. The stack overflow article that helped me solve this problem can be found [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41691770/spring-boot-unable-to-serve-static-image-from-resource-folder).

For the initial project design reference view the UML displayed below
 - Note: PaymentType is wrongfully linked to Visitor instead of Employee
 - However, code for PaymentType is properly implemented
 - An updated UML with any additional functionality beyond requirements will be added if needed
